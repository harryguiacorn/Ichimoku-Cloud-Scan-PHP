Cloud Service
A full-stack website which scans for trading signals across major indices such as S&P 500 and their constituents based on Ichimoku Cloud indicator using PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Yahoo Finance.
A stock is considered as a potential candidate to be bought when the price goes above the Ichimoku Cloud and vice versa.
However, the Kijun-sen is often overlooked in most Ichimoku books as the first reliable hint for a stock to change from downwards sentiment to upwards and vice versa, hence, the direction to which Kijun-sen points is programmed into the scan.
